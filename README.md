# STUDENT-FACULY-RATIO-CALCULATOR
Idea here is to predict the exact count of staffs required per department and also calculate how many staffs are still required to satisfy the student faculty ratio for per department. And show the student faculty ratio valid or invalid per department. This implementation will reduce manual time to allocate staffs.
